    <div class="message warning">
What would you do?
Do you really want to just die like this?
You do not have to.
    </div>

  <div class="message alert">
Would you be satisfied with your life if you have died?
You do not have to dissapear.
There is a countless list of after life online services. With ghostmemo.com you can't let your pets starve to death after you died.
I would even feel inevitably guilty when I would be a pet owner not subscribing to this website.
Ghostmemo sends periodic proof of life email requests, when you fail to respond the website will send your own emergency messages to your emergency contacts.
It operates like a Dead Man's Switch or, in their words, like an Unconscious Man's Messaging Service.
